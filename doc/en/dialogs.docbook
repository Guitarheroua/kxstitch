        <para>
            The palette manager allows you to add, remove or swap flosses from your current palette and the selected scheme.
            You can remove all non used flosses from your current palette and you are able to add new flosses to the scheme.
            Additionally you can bring up the floss calibration dialog from here.
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            For each of the flosses you can allocate a symbol.  The symbol selector dialog shows all the available
            symbols.  Unusable symbols are shown as a box, already used symbols are shown in red.  The symbol shown
            on the blue background is the current symbol for the selected floss.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can allocate the number of strands of cotton used for each floss, for both stitching and backstitching.
            This information will be used in calculating the amount of floss required in the final design.
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            The dialog shows the name of the scheme that the new color will be added to. The color requires a name
            and a description, which can be anything you want, although color name will usually be defined by the
            floss manufacturer.
        </para>
        <para>
            Clicking on the Color button will show a standard KDE color selection dialog. The initial color can be
            selected and then the parameters can be adjusted to give the correct color.
        </para>
        <para>
            Once added this new color will be available to be included in your patterns palette via the 'Add Color'
            dialog. It may also be adjusted by using the 'Floss Calibration' dialog.
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            This dialog has two parts.
        </para>
        <para>
            On the left, a pick list of the schemes that are currently available along with a list of colors that
            are in that scheme.  The color description will be appended with '(Calibrated)' if the color has been
            modified by the current invocation of this dialog.
        </para>
        <para>
            On the right, is the name and description of the currently selected color, this will be appended with
            '(Modified)' if the color has been modified, a preview of the color, and the current RGB values for the color.
        </para>
        <para>
            Also shown is a 'Reset Color' button. This will reset the currently selected color to the value it had
            when the dialog was first invoked.
        </para>
        <para>
            Pressing the 'OK' button will commit all of the changed colors.
        </para>
        <para>
            Pressing the 'Cancel' button will restore all the changed colors back to their original values.
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            This dialog lets you configure some of the &kapp; display parameters.
        </para>
        <para>
            Most of the options are self explanatory.  The check boxes enable or disable the display of various
            elements. The pick lists allow selection of the required format of those elements.
        </para>
        <para>
            The cell size value is the size of a grid square in screen pixels. The grouping value is the number
            of squares in a major group, i.e. between the heavier lines.  It may be necessary to change the grid line
            colors if you work on dark materials and have set the patterns background color accordingly.
        </para>
        <para>
            The scale size is the width of the border in screen pixels.  You may need to adjust this if you have
            large patterns and want to see the full text of the scales.
        </para>

    <sect1 id="ImportImageDlg" >
        <title>The Import Image Dialog</title>
        <para>
            <screenshot><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="import-image-dialog.png" format="PNG" /></imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
        </para>
        <para>
            On the left of the dialog there is a preview of the imported image, based on the parameters on the right.
        </para>
        <para>
            The floss scheme for the finished pattern can be selected, by default this is the same as the 'New
            Pattern Dialog' defaults. The maximum colors to be used for the pattern can be enabled and changed as
            required, by default the imported pattern will have as many colors as are defined in the original image
            that are converted to floss colors. Checking the Ignore Color box allows you to click the dropper tool to
            select a color in the image that will be ignored on import. This is useful to remove backgrounds that you
            don't need converting to stitches. The ignored color will be displayed as a checker board pattern in the preview.
        </para>
        <para>
            The cloth count value defaults to the 'New Pattern Properties' dialog and the scale is set such that
            the final size is as close to the 'New Pattern Properties' pattern size as possible. These values can be
            changed as required.
        </para>
        <para>
            The Use fractionals checkbox will enable the use of fractional stitches in the imported pattern.  This
            effectively doubles the import resolution without affecting the overall size of the pattern.
        </para>
        <para>
            Clicking 'Import' will convert the image into a pattern.
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            The pattern size can be defined in units of stitches, centimeters or inches.
            The width and height values will updated automatically to the equivalent size in the new unit type if
            the units type is changed.
        </para>
        <para>
            The cloth count is defined in units per centimeter or inches and is dependent on the units of size.
            i.e. if CM is selected for the units then cloth count will be in units per centimeter, similarly for inches.
            if the Stitches unit is selected then the cloth count units will remain as the last CM or inches value.
        </para>
        <para>
            The Title, Author, Copyright and Fabric fields are free text, so you can enter anything you like
            here. The fabric color can be set by pressing the color button and selecting the required color. This will
            then be shown in the editor and preview windows.
        </para>
        <para>
            The floss scheme has a pick list for all the available floss schemes, including any that you have
            defined yourself.
        </para>
        <para>
            The 'Set as default' checkbox will save the current values which will then be used as defaults
            for all new patterns.
        </para>
        <para>
            The Instructions tab can be used to enter any specific instructions for sewing the pattern.

        <title>The Pattern Library Dialog</title>
        <para>
            <screenshot><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="library-manager-dialog.png" format="PNG" /></imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
        </para>
        <para>
            The Pattern Library Manager has a hierarchical tree view (more of a forest really) of categories
            on the left with an icon view of the selected category of patterns on the right.  This dialog is non modal
            and can be left open whilst working on the pattern.
        </para>
        <para>
            The simplest way to use the library patterns is to drag and drop them onto the pattern space.  Alternatively
            using the &RMB; on a library pattern will show a context menu with an option to copy it, this can then be pasted
            into the pattern as many times as required.
        </para>
        <para>
            Additional items on the context menu are:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>Delete: Delete a library item, for which a confirmation dialog is shown.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Add to Export List: Allows you to create a list of items to export, perhaps to send to someone.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Properties: Show the properties dialog for the item.</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            The properties dialog for each item displays its size and the floss scheme used, the baseline value and the associated
            keyboard character.  The baseline is used to position the character pattern vertically relative to the cursor position
            when using the Alphabet tool.  Positive values move it down, negative values move it up.  The associated character is
            only required for use with the Alphabet tool.  After clicking in the associated character text box, the next key press, including
            modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, etc) is used as the key.
        </para>
        <para>
            Create new libraries by clicking the &RMB; on either an existing category, to create a sub category, or on a blank area of the library
            list, for a new top level category, and select the New Category option, enter the name and click OK.
        </para>
        <para>
            Creating a new library pattern by selecting an area in the pattern editor, select copy, then use the &RMB; on an existing category
            and select paste.  If necessary you can use the properties option to add an associated key if you want to use it as a character library.
        </para>
        <para>
            Library patterns can be dragged and dropped to other libraries in the list to allow you to rearrange them to your needs.  Note that there
            is no checks to ensure that the key codes assigned to library patterns is unique and you should modify any that duplicate an existing one.

        <para>
            The text dialog allows you to select a font and size, then enter the text.  Clicking OK closes the
            dialog and returns you to the &kapp; window. Positioning the text is the same as pasting any other
            element. Press the &LMB; on the canvas roughly where you want the text, this will show a preview of
            the text, position the text exactly where you want it, then release the &LMB;
